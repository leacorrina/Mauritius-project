            <h2>History of Mauritius</h2>
            <p>
              The Republic of Mauritius comprises a collection of islands in the
              Indian Ocean, East of the African continent and Madagascar. The
              main island, Mauritius, is home to the capital city, Port Louis;
              other islands include Rodrigues, Agel√©ga, and St. Brandon. In
              October 2024, the UK ceded sovereignty of the archipelago of
              Chagos to the Republic of Mauritius.
            </p>
            <p>
              The islands are said to have been uninhabited until colonized by
              the Dutch in 1598, then the French in 1715, and finally the
              British in 1814. The colonizers enslaved African and Malagasy
              people, and when slavery was abolished in 1835, the British
              brought indentured laborers from India. Traders from China and
              Arab regions also influenced the culture of the islands. After
              gaining independence in 1968, the Republic of Mauritius was formed
              in 1992.

            <h2>The Underwater Waterfall</h2>
            <p>
              This wonder of nature can be found off the SW coast of the main
              island of Mauritius, near the Le Morne Peninsula. After being
              formed by volcanic activity 8 million years ago, the Mascarene
              Islands (including several islands of the Republic of Mauritius
              and neighboring French island Reunion) sit on an ocean shelf. As
              sand falls from this shelf into the depths of the ocean, it
              creates a waterfall effect visible from above. There are
              helicopter and seaplane tours for the best views, and it can be
              partially seen after hiking to the top of Le Morne Brabant.

                The Mauritius Coat of Arms includes images of the dodo and the
                sambar deer, both native species affected by hunting and habitat
                destruction. The dodo was a flightless bird unique to Mauritius
                that went extinct in the 17th century. The sambar deer has been
                listed as a vulnerable species since 2008.
